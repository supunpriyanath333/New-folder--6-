        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Sri Lankan Plantations, a dedicated platform aimed at educating and informing visitors about the rich heritage and significance of plantations in Sri Lanka. Our focus is on key crops such as tea, rubber, coconut, and cinnamon, each of which plays a vital role in the country’s economy and culture.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the diverse agricultural landscape of Sri Lanka. We aim to promote awareness of the historical, economic, and cultural importance of plantations, while advocating for sustainable practices that benefit local communities and the environment.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Why Plantations Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Plantations are integral to Sri Lanka's identity. The tea estates, often referred to as the "Ceylon Tea Gardens," not only contribute significantly to the economy through exports but also represent a unique aspect of the country’s landscape and heritage. Similarly, rubber and coconut plantations provide livelihoods for thousands of families and contribute to the local and national economy.
